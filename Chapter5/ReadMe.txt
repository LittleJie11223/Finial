This chapter is mainly composed of 3 parts.
The frequency statistics of individual words and phrases in section 5.2.
 Test of different dimensions of Word2Vec in section 5.3. Porcelain vase statistics and Word2Vec mixed mode in section 5.4.

Among them, 5.2:
1. DataWF.py: The word frequency statistics function of single words
and phrases are encapsulated in the file, and the training data and parameters required
by the depth model can be directly called.
2. TestWFLSTM.py: The file is the LSTM depth model of the word frequency statistics of the test phrase
3. TestWFSLSTM.py: LSTM depth model of the word frequency statistics of a single word when testing a file

Among them 5.3:
1. DataW2V.py: encapsulates the function of converting the statistical word frequency
 according to the phrase into a 1-dimensional function. Through this function, you can
 directly obtain the processed training data and the parameters required by the model.
2. DataW2V2D4.py: encapsulates a function that converts the statistical word frequency
according to the phrase into a 4-dimensional function. This function can be used to directly
obtain the processed training data and the parameters required by the model. Change the dimension of
192 lines in the file, and the training data in the file will also become the corresponding dimension.
3. TestW2VLSTM.py: This file corresponds to the deep learning LSTM network simulation file generated by DataW2V.py.
4. TestW2V2LSTM.py: This file corresponds to the simulation of the deep learning LSTM
network generated by DataW2V2D4.py. And change the value of 192 mysize in DataW2V2D4.py,
the corresponding network will also simulate the corresponding word2vec dimension. But it is
 worth noting that when the number of dimensions exceeds 2, the simulation time will increase
 accordingly, and the computer computing resources occupied will also increase.

Among them 5.4:
1. DataTest1.py: This file encapsulates the word frequency statistics
 and the mixed model processing training data of Word2Vec. Word frequency statistics
 and Word2Vec both classify and count the steps. Through this file, the processed data and
 the parameters required by the deep network can be obtained.
2. DataWFW2V4.py: The function of this file is the same as DataTest1.
3. TestMyMixDeep.py: This file is a multi-layer CNN network fitting without Embedding layer.
The corresponding data acquisition is DataTest1.py.
4. TestWFW2VL.py: This file is LSTM deep network fitting with Embedding layer.
The corresponding data acquisition is DataWFW2V4.py.

In this folder are 3 random test codes:

The first is under the folder
1. MyDataAll1.py: This file is initially run, and
then the trained Word2Vec is saved as a MCNNMM_Ingredient_Word2vec file,
 so that the remaining files can directly use the trained model.
2. RTMCNNData.py: Used to load the word2vec model that has been trained,
and then process and clean all the training data and then transfer the data like a deep network.
3. MCNNMM_Ingredient_Word2vec is a Word2Vec model trained by MyDataAll1.py.

In folder 6_1:
1. MCNNMMRT.txt: Show the results of 100 random tests
2. myMCNNMM_model.h5: The multi-layer CNN deep network model that has been trained.
3. RandomTestMCNNMM.py: The deep network code for 100 sets of random tests, where the training data is loaded in the RTMCNNData.py file.
 The loaded depth model is trained by TestAll1.py that has been trained.

In folder 6_2:
1.myCNNLSTM_model.h5: The trained multi-layer CNN and LSTM hybrid model file.
2. TestCNNLSTM.py: It is a deep network file used to test the effect of multi-layer CNN and LSTM hybrid model training.
The training results are not ideal. So there is no random test situation and result.

In folder 6_3:
1. Mixresult.txt: This is the 100 random test training result file of the multi-layer CNN,
LSTM and fully-linked layer hybrid model.
2. myCLD_model.h5: a well-trained multi-layer CNN, LSTM and fully linked layer hybrid model deep network.
3. RandomTestCLD.py: 100 sets of programs for randomly testing mixed models.
4. RTCLD.py: The program used to train the mixed model and save the trained model as myCLD_model.h5.
